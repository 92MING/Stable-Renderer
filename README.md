# Stable Renderer
An engine connecting OpenGL & Stable Diffusion


## TODO

### BUGS
- `depth map`: seems only outputting last obj? (when multiple objs are rendered)
- `OBJ load`: error when :
    - loading faces with more than 3 vertices 
    - meets `g` label in .obj

### Features
- `general baking system`
    - baking algorithms
- `comfyUI`
    - baking nodes
