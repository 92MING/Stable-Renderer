# Create Custom ComfyUI Node 

There's 2 ways to create your custom node

### Option 1: Inherit from `BaseNode` class (Recommended)

You can create a node type simply by inheriting from the `BaseNode` from `comfyUI/types` module. For example:

```python
from comfyUI.types import *
from typing import Tuple

class MyNode(BaseNode):
    '''You can annotated your node, and the information will also be passed to the UI.'''

    Category = "My Category"    # optional, the category of the node

    def __call__(self, 
                 
                 image: IMAGE, # required input, IMAGE is the special type refers to the same "IMAGE" in comfyUI legacy node system
                 
                 prompt: PROMPT,    # hidden input, since `PROMPT` is a hidden type, the value will be pass to you during runtime
                 
                 x: INT(min=0, max=4096, step=1) = 1,   # optional input with default value 1
                 
                 text: str = "Hello World!",    # you could also use python built-in types instead of `INT`, `FLOAT`, `STRING`... 
                 
                 ) -> Tuple[LATENT, UI[IMAGE]]: # define your return type like this

        ... # do something
```

The has no limitation in where you put your node class, just ensure your module/codes will be executed once during the initialization. 

Of coz, it is recommended to put under `comfyUI/custom_nodes`, as all modules under this directory will be loaded automatically 

For more details, you can refer to the `comfyUI/types/node_base.py`.

--------------------------------------------

### Option 2: Legacy way in ComfyUI

Define your custom node like this, and define the `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` and `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS` in the same file/module. 

Also, your code must be put under `comfyUI/custom_nodes` directory.

For more details, you could refer to `ComfyUINode` in the `comfyUI/types/node_base.py` file, which is a Protocol type that helps you to create legacy custom nodes. 

```python
class Example:
    """
    A example node

    Class methods
    -------------
    INPUT_TYPES (dict): 
        Tell the main program input parameters of nodes.
    IS_CHANGED:
        optional method to control when the node is re executed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    RETURN_TYPES (`tuple`): 
        The type of each element in the output tulple.
    RETURN_NAMES (`tuple`):
        Optional: The name of each output in the output tulple.
    FUNCTION (`str`):
        The name of the entry-point method. For example, if `FUNCTION = "execute"` then it will run Example().execute()
    OUTPUT_NODE ([`bool`]):
        If this node is an output node that outputs a result/image from the graph. The SaveImage node is an example.
        The backend iterates on these output nodes and tries to execute all their parents if their parent graph is properly connected.
        Assumed to be False if not present.
    CATEGORY (`str`):
        The category the node should appear in the UI.
    execute(s) -> tuple || None:
        The entry point method. The name of this method must be the same as the value of property `FUNCTION`.
        For example, if `FUNCTION = "execute"` then this method's name must be `execute`, if `FUNCTION = "foo"` then it must be `foo`.

For outputting image to the UI, you can refer to the example below:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO
import numpy as np
import struct
import comfy.utils
import time

#You can use this node to save full size images through the websocket, the
#images will be sent in exactly the same format as the image previews: as
#binary images on the websocket with a 8 byte header indicating the type
#of binary message (first 4 bytes) and the image format (next 4 bytes).

#The reason this node is disabled by default is because there is a small
#issue when using it with the default ComfyUI web interface: When generating
#batches only the last image will be shown in the UI.

#Note that no metadata will be put in the images saved with this node.
